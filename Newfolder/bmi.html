    <P> Being 'overweight' means having more body fat than is optimally healthy. Being overweight is common, especially where food supplies are plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary.
    Excess weight has reached epidemic proportions globally, with more than 1 billion adults being either overweight or obese in 2003. In 2013 this increased to more than 2 billion. Increases have been observed across all age groups.</P>

    <FONT color="VIOLET" face="COMIC SANS MS " size="5"> <U> What is being 'Underweight' ? </U> </FONT> <BR>
    <P> 'Underweight' is a term describing a person whose body weight is considered too low to be healthy. <BR>
    The definition usually refers to people with a body mass index (BMI) of under 18.5 or a weight 15% to 20% below that normal for their age and height group. Being underweight can damage your health. Weighing too little can contribute to a weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired. </P>
    <P> If you're concerned about being underweight, check your body mass index (BMI) using our <A href="http://localhost/bmi.PHP">BMI calculator</A> . </BR>
    If your BMI is below the healthy range (>18.5), this suggests that your weight may be too low. <BR>
    If you're underweight, your GP (general physician) or practice nurse can give you help and advice. There might be an underlying medical cause for your low weight, such as an overactive thyroid. <BR> </P> <BR> <CENTER>
